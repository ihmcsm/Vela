# Vela Maps - Privacy

> What leaves your phone, where it goes, and what it doesn't. Written to be honest

## TL;DR

- **"Degoogled" means what it means for NewPipe.** Nothing of Google runs on or is
  installed on your phone: no Play Services, no Google SDK, no account, no API key.
  Google's public servers still answer the app's anonymous requests - that is the whole
  design, a libre front end to Google's data, not a claim of zero Google contact.
- **There is no Vela server.** Vela has no backend, no account, no analytics, no crash
  reporting, no ad SDK. Nothing you do is sent to *us* - there is no "us" to send it to.
- **Vela talks to Google directly from your phone**, the same way `maps.google.com`
  in a browser does, for search / places / routing / traffic. Google therefore sees
  your **IP address**, your **search text**, and the **map area** of each request - 
  but **not a Google account** (you're never signed in) and **no app/API key** that
  labels the traffic as "Vela."
- A few **non-Google open services** get small, specific requests (map tiles, reverse
  geocoding, terrain, fallback routing) - see the table.
- **Your places, history, and settings stay on the device.** Saved/Home/Work/recent
  places, preferences, and downloaded offline areas are local only; they're never
  uploaded anywhere.

## What each service receives

| Service | When | What it gets | What it does **not** get |
|---|---|---|---|
| **google.com** (search/place) | every search, place open | your IP, the query text, the map viewport (lat/lng), a logged-out session cookie | your Google account, name, device ID, contacts |
| **google.com** (directions) | planning a route | your IP, origin + destination coordinates, viewport | account; your live position isn't sent unless you navigate |
| **google.com** (directions, in-drive) | while NAVIGATING: on every off-course reroute, and every ~2 min for the live traffic re-check | your IP, your **current position** + the destination | account. The periodic re-check is what powers faster-route offers, the live arrival time and step recovery; it can be turned off in Settings → Data & privacy ("Live traffic re-checks"), leaving only the off-course reroutes, which navigation can't work without |
| **google.com** (reviews/photos) | opening reviews / the photo gallery | your IP, the place's feature id | account (photos load via an **anonymous** hidden WebView - see below) |
| **google.com / googleapis.com** (Street View) | opening Street View on a place, walking between panos, going back in time | your IP, the place's coordinate (nearest-pano lookup), then panorama ids and image-tile coordinates | account; no query text - the requests match what an incognito browser makes on Google's own Street View |
| **google.com/maps/vt** (traffic) | traffic overlay on | your IP, the tile coordinates you're viewing | anything tied to you beyond IP |
| **OpenFreeMap** | viewing the map | your IP, which map tiles you pan over | no search/place text - just tile coordinates |
| **OSM Nominatim** | long-pressing to drop a pin | your IP, that one lat/lng | nothing else |
| **AWS (terrarium DEM)** | hillshade relief | your IP, tile coordinates | nothing else |
| **FOSSGIS OSRM** | every route you plan | your IP, origin/destination (and waypoint) coordinates | the primary turn-by-turn router; Google is queried in parallel only for the traffic ETA |
| **Overpass (OSM)** | "download this area", offline address indexing, and traffic-light/stop-sign icons at close zoom | your IP, the bounding box | nothing else |
| **raw.githubusercontent.com** | once at launch (config refresh) | your IP, a plain file fetch | no data *about you* is sent - it's a download |
| **GitHub release assets** | downloading offline regions/voices, checking for app updates, and streaming the building/house-number overlays as you browse (small ranged tile reads) | your IP, which file or tile byte-range is fetched (implies your rough map area for the overlays) | no query text, no account |

## Google, specifically

Because Vela scrapes Google rather than running its own maps stack, Google is the
service that sees the most. Concretely, per request Google receives **your IP
address, the search/route text or coordinates, the map area, a browser-like
User-Agent, and short-lived consent cookies** (`SOCS`/`CONSENT`, seeded in memory so
the EU consent wall doesn't block you - they carry no identity).

What Google does **not** get from Vela:
- **No Google account / sign-in.** Vela never logs in. There is no Gmail, no profile,
  no "your timeline."
- **No shared API key.** Requests aren't stamped as coming from an app called "Vela";
  they look like an ordinary logged-out browser hitting `maps.google.com`.
- **No persistent identity from Vela.** The session cookies are in-memory and
  per-session; Vela doesn't attach a device id or a stable user id.

**Versus the official Google Maps app:** there, you're normally signed in, so Google
ties every search, route, and stop to your account and builds your Maps history and
location profile. With Vela it's closer to using `google.com/maps` in a **private /
incognito browser window**: Google still sees the IP and the individual requests, but
can't link them to a Google account or your real-world identity. The honest limit:
**your IP is still visible to Google** (and to every service in the table) - that's
inherent to fetching from them. If you want to hide that too, run Vela over a **VPN or
Tor**; it works over any network.

Row by row, the same comparison the README summarizes:

| What Google gets | Google Maps app | Google Maps web | Vela |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tied to your Google account | Yes, always signed in | Yes unless incognito | Never - there is no login |
| A persistent device identifier | Yes (device + ad IDs via Play Services) | Browser cookies | No account, no app key; just an IP like any website visitor |
| Your precise GPS position | Continuously while open, plus Location History if enabled | While the tab is open | Never while browsing - position stays on the phone; searches send the map area you are looking at. While navigating, anonymous re-routes and the optional live-traffic re-check send your current position (toggleable in Settings, see the table above) |
| Every pan and zoom of the map | Yes - their servers render the map | Yes | No - map tiles come from OpenFreeMap, so Google never sees you browse |
| Your searches | Yes, saved to your account history | Yes | The query text reaches Google anonymously, only when you search |
| Place pages you open | Yes | Yes | The place lookup reaches Google anonymously |
| Turn-by-turn routes | Yes, full trip telemetry | Yes | Routing runs on open OSRM/GraphHopper; Google is asked anonymously for the traffic ETA, plus your current position during in-drive re-routes and re-checks. Your GPS trail as a whole never leaves the phone |
| Saved places, home, work | Stored on their servers | Stored on their servers | Stored only on your phone |
| Ad profile building | Feeds your ads profile | Feeds your ads profile | Nothing to attach it to |
| Works with no Google contact at all | No | No | Yes - downloaded regions search, route, and navigate fully offline |

## The hidden WebViews (photos, reviews, transit, popular times)

Four features - the **full photo gallery**, **reviews**, **public-transit directions**
and **popular times** - are only served to a real browser engine, so Vela loads `maps.google.com` in a **hidden,
logged-out WebView** and reads the result. This is the one place Google's own
JavaScript runs on your device. It runs **anonymously** (no login), but, like any
browser visit to Google, that JS *could* set cookies or fingerprint the browser. It's
an explicit, scoped tradeoff for data a plain request can't get; if you never open the
photo gallery or transit directions, that WebView never loads.

## What stays on your device

Stored locally only (SharedPreferences / SQLite / MapLibre's offline store), never
transmitted:
- Saved places, Home/Work shortcuts, recently-viewed places, recent searches
- Settings (theme, units, voice engine, traffic toggle, keep-screen-on-while-navigating)
- Downloaded offline map areas + their offline POIs
- Dismissed-notice ids

There is no cloud sync. Uninstalling the app removes all of it.

**Contacts (optional, off by default).** If you turn on Settings > Search > "Search your
contacts", typing a contact's name suggests their saved postal address. The contact list is
read and matched entirely on this phone (the permission is asked when you flip the toggle,
never at install). Nothing about your contacts is uploaded; if you tap a suggestion, the
ADDRESS text is searched exactly as if you had typed it yourself, which sends that one
string to the geocoder like any other search.

## No tracking

Vela contains **no analytics, no advertising, no crash reporting, and no
Firebase/Play Services**, and **no telemetry that runs without you turning it on**. The
app makes network requests only to the services in the table above, only when a feature
needs them. It's GPLv3 - you can read every request the code makes in
[`core/data/google`](core/src/main/java/app/vela/core/data/google) and [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).

## Voice search (optional)

The search-bar mic turns speech into a query one of two ways, both privacy-preserving:

- **On your phone (Vela's own model).** If you download the ~47 MB speech model
  (Settings -> Search), tapping the mic records into Vela and transcribes **entirely on
  the device** with a bundled Whisper model. The audio is never written to disk and never
  leaves the phone; there is no account and no network request for the transcription. Vela
  asks for the microphone permission only the first time you tap the mic.
- **Another voice app.** If instead you use an installed voice-input app (for example FUTO
  Voice Input), tapping the mic hands off to that app through Android's standard
  speech-recognition intent. **That app records the audio, not Vela** - Vela sends it
  nothing and only gets the recognized text back to drop into the search box, so it needs
  no microphone permission for this path.

The mic only appears when one of these is available, and the whole feature can be turned
off in Settings -> Search.

## Diagnostics (opt-in, off by default)

Settings → **Diagnostics** has one switch, **off by default**. When you turn it on, Vela
keeps a short **local** log of what it did - your searches, the routes it computed, and
any "needs recalibration" hiccups - so that if something misbehaves you can **export it
and hand it to a developer** to debug. Specifics:

- **Nothing is uploaded by Vela.** The log lives only on your phone (a small local file while
  the opt-in is on). The only
  way it leaves is if *you* tap **Export debug session** and then choose where to send it
  (email, a chat app, Files…). You see it's a file; you pick the destination.
- **It contains** the breadcrumbs above - which can include your search terms, the
  start/end coordinates of routes you asked for, and **navigation breadcrumbs** (a
  start/arrival line with the destination name and the drive's distance + time, plus
  "GPS gap" markers noting where the signal dropped and for how long - for debugging a
  bad route or *tuning the turn-by-turn*). No account, no contacts, no continuous
  location trail.
- **Turning it off wipes the log.** Exports also scrub coordinates down to ~1 km before the
  share sheet ever sees them, so a pasted report can't pinpoint you.

## Trip recording (separate opt-in, off by default)

Settings → **"Save my trips"** is a **second, distinct switch**, also **off by default**
and **more revealing** than diagnostics - so it's deliberately separate, and the first-run
prompt asks for it on its own line.

- When on, Vela records the **GPS trace of each navigation** (the points along your drive
  + the destination) to a **file on your phone**, so a trip can be **replayed** later to
  test turn-by-turn without driving it again.
- This is your **exact routes and movement** - the most sensitive thing the app stores.
  **Vela never uploads it** - there is no auto-upload code path. The only way a trace
  leaves the phone is if *you* tap **Share** on a trip and choose where to send it (the
  same user-initiated FileProvider export as the diagnostics log) - useful for handing a
  drive to a developer to debug a bad route.
- **Share offers to trim the private ends first, and that is the default button.** A drive
  starts and ends where you do, so publishing a raw trace publishes your front door. Choosing
  **Share trimmed** deletes every recorded point within a distance you pick (200 / 400 / 800 m)
  of the start, the end, the recorded destination, and your **Home and Work** if you have set
  them, and with them the trip's name (trips are named after where they went, so it is usually
  an address), the destination coordinate in the file header, the spoken directions at either
  end, and the start of the saved route line. Timestamps are rebased to zero, so the file does
  not say *when* you drive either. The middle of the drive is kept at **full precision**, because
  that is the part a bug lives in. Rounding coordinates instead would protect the ends weakly
  (a 1 km round still names a block) while destroying what the trace is for. The dialog shows
  what it removed, and the first surviving coordinate, before anything leaves the device. The
  untrimmed file is still available behind **Share full trace**, and the copy on your phone is
  never modified.
- Manage it in Settings → recorded trips have **Replay**, **Share**, and **Delete**;
  turning the switch off stops new recording. Off by default; you choose to enable it.

A future, **separately-announced** opt-in may aggregate anonymized speed traces to build
Vela's own traffic layer - that one needs a server and a fresh consent screen, and this
file will change the day it ships. It does not exist today.
