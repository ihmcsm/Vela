# Map style

The basemap, fonts, custom layers and theming details.

The active basemap is the keyless **OpenFreeMap Liberty** style (full street
detail; we inject house-number labels, visible from z18.3), loaded **by URL** - the only setup
that reliably renders vector tiles on-device. Over it we apply a Google-like look
at **runtime**, by system theme:

- **POI markers** - small category-coloured dots with white Material Icons
  glyphs (food orange, shops blue, parks green, …) in front of a muted-grey
  teardrop pin with a soft shadow (Google-style, no white ring), with the label
  to the **left** of the icon; in **light** mode the POI label text is coloured
  by category too, like Google.
- **Roads, Google-style** - white road fills on a light-grey land, with the
  casings **faded out down the hierarchy** until the minor-road casing equals the
  land, so streets are clean white lines with **no outline** (the outlines were
  what made it look un-Google); soft-yellow motorways; bridges mirror their tier.
- **Building footprints + house numbers** - flat grey footprints with a crisp
  outline from neighbourhood zoom (3D extrusions at street zoom), and OSM house
  numbers at close zoom (the layer arms at z17 for tile fetch, text fades in from z18.3), both
  keyless from the OpenFreeMap tiles. Density follows
  OpenStreetMap coverage (dense in metros, patchy in some suburbs).
- **Neutralised landuse** - the tan/yellow residential/commercial/school fills are
  flattened into the land (Google keeps these untinted), so no colored blobs.
- **Light / dark** - a light-grey-land light palette and Google's canonical night
  palette for dark; casings blend into the land in **both** so roads stay clean.
  (Palette tuned live in a MapLibre GL JS harness against Google, then verified
  on-device in light + dark.)
- **Terrain relief (hillshade)** - shaded relief from the keyless open **terrarium**
  DEM (AWS Open Data; native fetch, no key, no CORS), added under the road layers
  and capped at z16, tuned per theme (a soft warm-grey shadow in light, deeper
  shadows + a cool highlight in dark). Verified in a MapLibre GL JS harness
  against the real DEM tiles before shipping.

A `MAPTILER_KEY` (CI secret) path stays wired but **off** (`USE_MAPTILER` in
`MapScreen`): with a key it switches to **MapTiler Streets / Streets Dark**
(proper fonts) instead of the keyless recolor. The old keyless font ceiling is
gone: map labels render in Roboto from a self-hosted glyph set (Roboto
composited over OpenFreeMap's Noto per glyph, so every non-Latin script keeps
full coverage; `ui/map/MapFonts` patches the live style's glyphs URL at launch
and falls back to plain Noto if the host is unreachable). Self-hosted PMTiles is
the no-key, no-quota path for later. Styles are plain URLs, updatable over-the-air
without an app release.


## Archived palette: the pre-pixel-sample "greens fixed" look (commit 071c6c3)

The palette that shipped between the flat-vegetation work and the final
pixel-sampled match of the Google app (2026-07-11). No longer just an archive:
since 2026-07-11 it ships compiled as the **Classic** color set
(`applyClassicLight`/`applyClassicDark`), selectable in Settings → Appearance →
Map colors; the Google-sampled palette is **Modern**, the default (remote-
defaultable via calibration.json `defaultMapPalette`). The values below stay
as the reference for those functions.

Light: land `#f2f1ee`, water `#90daee`, park `#cfeccd`, grass `#d3f8e2`,
wood `#c9f2da`, wetland `#cdeff0`, plaza `#ededed`, buildings `#dde1e7`
(outline `#c4c9d1`, extrusion same fill), minor/secondary roads white with
casings `#e4e6ea`, trunk/primary casing `#dadde2`, arterial fills yellow
`#f9d27a` / motorway `#f0b85a` (the last Google-web-style yellows; the current
palette fills roads solid blue-grey like the app).

Dark: land `#242f3e`, water `#17263c`, park/grass `#2c4a34`, wood `#274330`,
wetland `#26403c`, plaza and other-landuse `#2a3546` (landuse at opacity 0.5),
buildings `#323f54` (outline `#3f4e66`, extrusion same fill), roads
`#49536a` minor / `#5e6a85` secondary / `#6f7a96` trunk+motorway, casings
`#242f3e` (= land). Greens here are true greens; the current sampled palette
uses Google's dark teal vegetation instead.
